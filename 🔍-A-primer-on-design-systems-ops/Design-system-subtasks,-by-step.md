# Breaking Down Step into Phases, Per Step
Delivering a feature like a component or visual style upgrade progresses through top-level steps like Propose, Design, Code, Doc and Release.

There are many activities in each step. So many that they feel unwieldy. So, when creating a process for a team, I'll encourage them to consider subtasks across phases of work, including:

- **`START`** sets up files (usually templates) and audits for reusable things
- **`COMPOSE`** involves what most perceive as "the work" to create something
- **`TEST`** involves assessing that work against standards of quality
- **`PRESENT`** involves the broader community for face-to-face discussion
- **`REVIEW`** involves peer inspection, with comments and corrections
- **`DELIVER`** involves the final edits, readying work for the next step

Different phases require different lengths of time. Phases like START and DELIVER move swiftly. COMPOSE requires many steps, the most work and the most time. TEST, PRESENT, and REVIEW include checks to ensure quality, involve the community, and trigger iteration to ensure things are made well.

Each major process step - Propose, Design, Code, Documentation-shares these common phases from start to finish, even if the subtasks vary for each.

For example, all steps start from a template, even though a Design template is far different from a Documentation authoring template (or is it?). A Design step tests some accessibility and possibly usability, whereas Code delves into more accessibility along with unit, regression, and functional tests.

Organizing work with phases, a teams can identify subtasks needed to deliver a robust, high quality feature predictably. The following sections illustrate common subtasks included in Propose, Design, Code and Doc steps.
