## Retrospective Purpose:
To examine how the just-completed sprint went as far as people, relationships, processes, and tools. Identify potential improvements. Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum team accomplishes its work.

## How to prepare
1. Create a new [Go Retro](https://app.goretro.ai/dashboard) public board.
   - Board name is today's date. Example: 08/23/2022
   - Max votes per user: 10
   - Template: What Went Well? What Didn't Go Well? What Can Be Improved?
   - Other preferences:
      - ✅ Hide cards initially
      - ✅ Disable votes initially
      - ✅ Hide vote count
   - After creation, change the "What Can Be Improved?" card to "Action items".
3. In "Apollo Team" -> "Team Retrospective" -> "Retro notes" create a new section for for the current retro.
   - Follow the same template as previous: Date, Retro board link, Carry-over action items, New action items.
   - Note: It might help to copy previous section and update it.

## Lead duties during meeting
1. Go over action items and update their status.
   1. Share your screen.
   2. Open "Apollo Team" -> "Team Retrospective" -> "Retro notes".
   3. Stop sharing your screen.
2. Share Go Retro link with the team.
3. Have team members write down cards for "What Went Well?" section. (5 minute timer)
4. Have team members write down cards for "What Didn't Go Well?" section. (5 minute timer)
5. Unhide cards.
6. Combine cards as needed.
7. Have team begin voting. (~4 minutes)

   - Note: Each team member will have to do this on their own.
9. Go over cards in alternative order.
   - Be on the lookout for possible conversations that could be turned into action items.
   - When writing action items, ask "Is this a good candidate for a task in ADO?"

## Post meeting lead duties
1. Clean up the Retro board as needed.
2. Add appropriate tasks to ADO.
3. Update "Team Retrospective" -> "Retro notes" with newly added action items.
4. Throughout the sprint, follow up with action items.
   - Call them out after standup to make sure team keeps them in mind.

## Extra notes:
- This is a safe space where people can speak their mind on how they feel.
- Be mindful and intentional.
- Assume that every team member, ultimately, wants what is best for the team.
