## Retrospective Purpose:
Define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

## How to prepare
1. Create a new sprint in [ADO](https://dev.azure.com/AB-Design/Apollo%20Design%20System/_sprints/taskboard/Web/Apollo%20Design%20System).
   - Name: QX Sprint X
   - Date field should automatically be set but double check
   - Location: Apollo Design System
2. Move items you know 100% will carry over.
3. In "Team Retrospective" -> "Retro notes" update action items status if necessary.

## Lead duties during meeting
1. Share your screen.
2. In "ðŸ•¸ Web" -> "Meeting Notes", check PI planning for priority.
   - Focus on the progress and overall status of the quarter and keep that in mind as we bring items into the new sprint.
3. Ask the team if they have any PTO planned for the new sprint.
   - This will give the team a better idea about capacity.
4. Go over current sprint board with the team.
5. Carry over and update status of tasks currently in progress.
6. Individually go around the room and determine if current developer has enough on their plate for the sprint.
   - If not, look at the priority together and determine what they feel comfortable taking on.
7. Create a new "Meetings lead" task under #928 and assign it to the next person in the [list](https://dev.azure.com/AB-Design/Apollo%20Design%20System/_wiki/wikis/Apollo-Design-Systems.wiki/137/Scrum-Ceremonies#:~:text=meetings%20every%20sprint%3A-,Lead,-Backup).
   - If Tuan is the next person in charge of leading meetings, notify him so that he is aware.

## Extra notes:
- Developers should try to expand their skillset so that we are more cross-functional.
- Keep an eye out for potential pair-programming opportunities.
