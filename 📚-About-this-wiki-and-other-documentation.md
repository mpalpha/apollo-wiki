# "How does the team document itself?"
A great question! So, for some meta-documentation, we utilize the following different knowledge repos:

## [Azure Boards](https://dev.azure.com/AB-Design/Apollo%20Design%20Systems/_boards/directory)
This is where we document the tangible product increment work and decompose items into tasks for tracking at the epic, feature, and backlog levels.

## Azure DevOps Wiki (what you're currently reading ðŸ‘€)
This is where we internally document processes for onboarding/knowledge sharing.

## [OneNote](https://amerisourcebergen.sharepoint.com/sites/ApolloDesignSystem/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B114df752-03fc-4c02-bd58-97f7befb622d%7D&action=editnew)
This is where we internally track findings, meetings, research, results, and decisions about things.

## [ZeroHeight](https://apollo.amerisourcebergen.com/)
This is where we document our assets for external consumption by product designers and software developers.
