> - Easing makes your animations feel more natural.
> - Choose ease-out animations for UI elements.
> - Avoid ease-in or ease-in-out animations unless you can keep them short; they tend to feel sluggish to end users.

> Easing out is typically the best for user interface work, because the fast start gives your animations a feeling of responsiveness, while still allowing for a natural slowdown at the end.

> - Use ease-out animations for UI elements; a Quintic ease-out is a very nice, albeit quick, ease.
> - Be sure to use the animation duration; ease-outs and ease-ins should be 200ms-500ms, whereas bounces and elastic eases should clock in a longer duration of 800ms-1200ms.
