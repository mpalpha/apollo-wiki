# Intro description
A button icon lets users take an action and visually conveys its behavior with an icon instead of text.

# Usage description
Use button icons to display supplementary actions in a compact layout. They can be grouped together or stand alone. They can represent opening actions or binary actions that can be toggled on and off. The icon’s meaning should be unambiguous and include an accessible label to describe the button’s action.
