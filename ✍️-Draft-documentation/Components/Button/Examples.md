# Button treatments

For the `abds-button` component, `appearance` and `palette` attributes are used to configure each button treatment below.

## Basic

Use this treatment for a button that resembles a plain text link while retaining button container dimensions. This button may be used frequently on a page and even multiple times per module. Use it when the button action is of secondary importance to the content surrounding it.

- `appearance="transparent"`
- `palette="brand"`

## Neutral

Use this treatment for a more discernible button than Basic. This button may be used frequently on a page and even multiple times per module. Use it when the button action is of secondary importance to the content surrounding it.

- `appearance="outline"`
- `palette="neutral"`

## Brand

Use this treatment for a very high contrast button on light backgrounds. This button should be used sparingly, to represent a primary action that stands out and is clearly more important than other actions on a page or module.

- `appearance="solid"`
- `palette="brand"`

- `appearance="outline"`
- `palette="brand"`

# Button with icon

An icon can both clarify a buttonâ€™s action and call attention to it. Refer to the usage guidelines for more details on appropriate use.

## Leading icon

To display a leading icon before text, add an `icon-start` attribute with the name of the icon to the `abds-button` component.

- `icon-start="calendar"`

## Trailing icon

To display a trailing icon after text, add an `icon-end` attribute with the name of the icon to the `abds-button` component.

- `icon-end="calendar"`

# Full-width button

By default, the width of a button is set to auto which dynamically changes based on its inner contents. To display a button that fills the width of its container, set the attribute to `full`:

- `width="full"`
