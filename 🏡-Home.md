# What is the Apollo Design System?

Located at apollo.amerisourcebergen.com, the goal of Apollo is to be the single source of truth for the robust libraries of UI components that we use to build AmerisourceBergen products, including usage and implementation guidelines.

# Why is Apollo important?

Apollo enables anyone to contribute towards digital experiences at AmerisourceBergen. It allows Product, Engineering, UX Design, and Contributors to work together more seamlessly and improve our product faster.

**It’s efficient.**

- Product Designers can spend more time solving problems and less time designing (and redesigning) UI components. Components can be reused, making design efforts scalable and ensuring our UI stays DRY.
- Engineers can reference design documentation that enables them to easily eliminate inconsistencies between design and code without assistance from a Product Designer.
- Engineers can find coding and development guidelines which will enable them to write better code and conform to set practices more efficiently.
- Product Managers can quickly propose solutions that follow documented usability guidelines.

**It creates a cohesive product.**

- AmerisourceBergen Teams can make fast, continuous feature additions within their iterative groups, while still maintaining consistency with other product areas.
- AmerisourceBergen Users can get up to speed more quickly on new features, because they don’t need to spend time learning how to interact with inconsistent UI patterns.
- Product Designers can feel more confident that their designs are visually appealing, consistent, and on brand.
- It enables Marketing and UX to create consistent experiences across AmerisourceBergen through a shared visual language.

**It helps AmerisourceBergen communicate.**

- We can more quickly envision and align on the details of how a proposed solution might be implemented.
- It proves to our customers and Contributors that we have a deep commitment to improving the experience of our UI.
- It improves alignment between departments through shared principles and personas.

# Who can contribute?

Everyone can contribute! Apollo is a living system, meaning it continually evolves to support new UI components and also deprecate outdated components. For this evolution to be scalable, we encourage everyone to contribute ideas, designs, code, and bug reports.

External contributions can be particularly valuable, because AmerisourceBergen Contributors have experiences and insights we may not have considered.

# When do we add a new component to Apollo?

Not every component used in the AmerisourceBergen product must be codified as part of the design system, because sometimes we create components that are relevant for only a specific use case in a distinct product area.

To learn more about when to add a new component to Apollo, read our component lifecycle documentation.

# What is the component development lifecycle?

The goal of this process is to make it easy to: submit new designs (including documentation), propose changes to existing designs, and translate component designs into built components.
